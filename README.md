## C++ is a compiled language
[<img width="300" target="_blank" src="images/cpp_is_a_compiled_language.jpeg">](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfGuIVzE_Os&t=341s)






## C++ is a statically typed language

* Modern C++ uses `type inference`   
* Read [Effective Modern C++, Item 1-6] for the rules, and read [[Style Guide]](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Type_deduction) for the guidelines   
  * Function template argument deduction    
  * `auto` (the only difference is on braced initialization)    
  * `decltype` ...   

## Self-contained Headers
* In general, every `.cc` file should have an associated `.h` file
* The `.h` files contain the declarations, while the `.cc` files contain the definitions 
* Place the declarations/definitions for `template` and `inline functions` in the header files

* All header files should be self-contained (compile on their own)  
* All header files should have `#define guards` to prevent multiple inclusion  

```cpp
#ifndef FOO_BAR_BAZ_H_  // <PROJECT>_<PATH>_<FILE>_H_
#define FOO_BAR_BAZ_H_
...
#endif  // FOO_BAR_BAZ_H_
```

* `#include` the headers you need; avoid using `forward declarations`  

## Smart Pointers
* Read [**Effective Modern C++**, Chapter 4, Item 18-22]
	* Use `std::unique_ptr` for exclusive-ownership resource management   
	* Use `std::shared_ptr` for shared-ownership resource management   
	* Use `std::weak_ptr` as `shared_ptr` that can dangle
		* caching, obeserver lists, prevention of `std::shared_ptr` cycles   
	* Prefer `std::make_unique` and `std::make_shared` to direct use of `new` (for thread-safety, efficiency)  
	* When using the Pimpl Idiom, define special member functions in the implementation file (avoid incomplete type)    

## Keyword `virtual`

* `virtual` member function is to support polymorphism;   
  - A `class` stores virtual functions in a virtual function table (`vtbl`), if any   
  - The derived class should not redefine inherited non-virtual functions       
  - The derived class can inherit, override, or introduce virtual functions    
  - The derived class must implement the pure virtual functions   
  - Explicitly annotate overrides with `override` or `final` (to catch bugs)     
  - Don't use `virtual` when declaring an `override` (to catch bugs)  
  - Polymorphic base classes normally declare virtual destructors. `virtual ~Base();`   
* `virtual inheritance` is to avoid the duplicated base class subobject that occurs with the “dreaded diamond”. 
  - Multiple implementation inheritance is strongly discouraged   
  - Where in a hierarchy should I use virtual inheritance? 
  - Just below the top of the diamond, not at the join-class.  

## Keyword `constexpr` & `const` 
* `constexpr` indicates a `compile-time` constant   
  - For objects, `constexpr` is `unconditional`    
  - For functions, `constexpr` is `conditional` on the arguements, thus avoiding code duplication    
* `const` indicates a `run-time` constant    
  - compilers use `bitwise` test to catch accidental writes, `if (a * b = c) { ... }`   
  - use `mutable` to free data members from the `bitwise` test   
  - `mutable` introduces data race for `const` memeber functions; use `atomic/mutex` for thread safety   
  - having the `non-const` member call the `const` version avoids code duplication (requires two casts: add `const` to `*this`, remove `const` from return value)    
* Use `constexpr` whenever possible (it's part of the interface, though)    
* Use `const` whenever possible  
* Prefer `const_iterator`s to `iterator`s    

## Some Tips

* Read Types Backwards

>> For people having trouble remembering the order in which `const` keyword is to be used, here's a quick tip. 
You have to read it backward, like the compiler does. For instance : 
>>
>> `const int* A;` // A is a pointer to an int that is constant  
>> `int const* A;` // A is a pointer to a const int   
>> `int* const A;` // A is a const pointer to an int  
>> `const int* const A;` // A is a const pointer to an int that is constant  
>> `T a[n];` // a is an array of n T's  
>> `T* a;`   // a is a pointer to a T  
>> `T& a;`   // a is a reference to a T  
>> `T f(A);` // f is a function, that takes an A, and returns a T  
>> `void f(const A&);` // f is a function, that takes a refernce to a const A, and returns nothing  
 
* OO (Polymorphic) vs OB (Nonpolymorphic): Use Pointers/References for Polymorphism        

>> <img width="600" src="images/OO_vs_OB.jpeg">

* `non-static` member function uses `this` pointer; `static` member function is `this`-less  

* Use `=default` to explicitly declare the default special member functions (constrcutor, desctructor, copy operations, move operations)
